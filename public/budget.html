            Finance, Marketting and Budget of Cold Fusion

                This project is very expensive as of now to research into and to finance it, it'd be wise to take it out of reducing the carbon impact that we're 
                spending too much resources into. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As we accelerate the research for this technology, the faster we'd be heading to net zero of carbon introducing this to various sectors reducing 
                the reliance of fossil fuels and nuclear-powered plants.

                Moores law states that every two years, transistors double in effiency. When we apply this law to Cold Fusion which work at quantum level, we'd be 
                making various contributions and accelerating in finding the efficient standards.

                It's stated that the US has used a 1990s technology which is 1% efficient, compared to 20% efficiency that our laser technology currently consists of.
                As the drive for invovation increases with the rising threat level of global warming, Cold Fusion will be focus in producing a clean energy.

                The method to market it to the wider audience for funding would be powering a small neightbourhood using Cold Fusion ensuring that the facility has up-to-date 
                infrastrucutre for optimum data collection.
