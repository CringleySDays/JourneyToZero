                As the output of the power is three times the power it draws. 
                This'll blow the oil driven economy out of the water as this process won't emit any green house gas. 
                On <span class="hyperlink-decoration" onclick="location.href='https://edition.cnn.com/us/live-news/nuclear-fusion-reaction-us-announcement-12-13-22/index.html'"> December 2022, </span> the US used their best laser and achieved 154 times the ignition and the waste product as tritium which is needed in the ignition process

                Using just 2.1 MJ and outputting 2.5 MJ of energy via lasers at room temperature would be the path the future generation of researchers will have to take
                for a cleaner, zero net approach for a sustainable production of energy.

                This kind of technology can be used in ship containers, in aviation heading towards zero net carbon. As the technology grows, this'll be embedded into
                modern day vehicles reducing the reliance on battery-powered vehicles as they are worse in damaging the ecosystem than green house gases emitted.

                Businesses would be able to apply for a scheme that reduces cost in electricity if they have invested in the research and development for a period of time
                generating funds for the project to accelerate and grow.
