            What is Cold Fusion?

                Cold Fusion is a method of energy production, where once it becomes successful, it'll output three times the power it draws. Some experts claim
                this will be the <span class="hyperlink-decoration" onclick="location.href='https://futurism.com/science-explained-the-physics-of-cold-fusion'"> energy of the future. </span> 
            </p>


            <p>
                Cold Fusion occurs near room temperature, which makes it very appealing for energy production in comparision to Hot Fusion where it involves intense heat
                and temperature which the current technology won't allow that for it to happen in an efficient method. The laser is blasted for less than a billionth of a second. If this went on for any longer, the conditions wouldn't be met for atoms to fuse.
