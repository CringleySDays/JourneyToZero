Running the file content, make sure to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) installed and having a code editor preferably a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Install [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to install the repository and to run the project.

### Content Changes:
- `main` branch consists of the original content whilst [main-two](https://github.com/CringleySDays/JourneyToZero/tree/main-two) consists of up-to-date content that I'm going to
further research. 

## Steps to Follow:
- Open git bash using right clicking onto the environment in file explorer for example to add clone the files into a folder that it'll create
- Enter in `git clone https://github.com/CringleySDays/JourneyToZero` in the git bash console
- Next open the folder in Visual Studio Code or your Code Editor of your choice and in the terminal Enter this command `npm install -g bun`
- In the terminal Enter in `bun install express` and then `bun index.js`
- Open a browser and enter in `localhost:8080` and tada you've successfully opened my project
